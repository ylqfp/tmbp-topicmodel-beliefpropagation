Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important class of hierarchical Bayesian models for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and computational biology. This manual introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP) based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms, which are implemented by MEX C++/MATLAB platform on either Windows or Linux system. Currently, this toolbox includes various learning algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), author-topic models (ATM), relational topic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an on-going project and more and more BP-based learning algorithms for various LDA-based topic models will be added in the near future. Interested readers may also extend this toolbox for solving more complicated topic modeling problems.
